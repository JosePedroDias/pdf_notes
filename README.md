# Purpose

I wanted to annotate a PDF file in my Linux box.
Didn't find any decent solution.

Found out [pdf.js](http://mozilla.github.com/pdf.js/), made a simple example in a couple of lines, found it awesome.

Trying to provide a simple way for people to read and annotate PDF files.
**FOR NOW** the notes are hardcoded in the notes variable.



# Dependencies

Uses the awesome [pdf.js](http://mozilla.github.com/pdf.js/) project by Mozilla.



# Roadmap

* smooth note editing stuff
* highlight current note?
* center page and allow padding
* zoom (fit page, fit width, fit height)
